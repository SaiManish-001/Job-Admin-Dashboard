# Steps to run application

**Frontend :** 
1) Open command prompt, go to the jobdashboard folder, and run the command **npm install**. This will download all the required dependencies to run your application.
2) Now you can run your application using **npm start** command.
3) You will see your application running in your default browser on localhost:3000.

**Backend :**
1) Install nodeJS dependencies using the commands **npm init -y** and **npm install express body-parser cors**
2) Open one more command prompt window, run the command **node server.js**.
3) You have to see **Server is running on http://localhost:5000** and **MongoDB connected successfully**

**MongoDB Usage:**
1) Install latest version of MongoDB (.msi file) from its official website.
2) Whenever you run your application, open the **mongodb.exe** file and let it be running in background.
3) If you dont want to download the application, you can also use MongoDB Atlas by creating your own custom cluster.
