# Steps to run application

**Frontend :** 
1) Open command prompt, go to the jobdashboard folder, and run the command **npm install**. This will download all the required dependencies to run your application.
2) Now you can run your application using **npm start** command.
3) You will see your application running in your default browser on localhost:3000.

**Backend :**
1) Install nodeJS dependencies using the commands **npm init -y** and **npm install express body-parser cors**
2) Open one more command prompt window, run the command **node server.js**.
3) You have to see **Server is running on http://localhost:5000** and **MongoDB connected successfully** statements in your cmd prompt.

**MongoDB Usage:**
1) Install latest version of MongoDB (.msi file) from its official website.
2) Whenever you run your application, open the **mongodb.exe** file and let it be running in background.
3) If you dont want to download the application, you can also use MongoDB Atlas by creating your own custom cluster.
4) If you dont customize your port or db name then by default your mongodb will be running on **mongodb://localhost:27017/jobdb**.
